<h1> IT Profile </h1>
<h2> <u> 1. Personal Information </u>  </h2>

<p> -My name is: Ngo Nhat Khanh </p>
<p> -My student number: s3818414 </p>
<p> -I’m a Vietnamese so it’s obvious that Vietnamese is my first language, through-out 12 years of education in VAS (Vietnam Australia international school) I was, and still am, able to use English as my second language. </p>
<p> -I usually play games with my best friends in my free time, or we just meet up in different coffee shop, restaurant to have a chat while enjoying the drinks and the food. I also participate the badminton club in RMIT when the club is available in certain days of the week.
</p>

<h2><u>  2. Interest in IT </u> </h2>
<ul>

<li> <b> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? </b> </li>
<p> I have always been a video game enthusiast, only in recent years I started to feel more interested in game development aside from just playing them. It all started out when I was a little kid in elementary school where my sister and I used to play games on the internet. There was this one game that left both of us such an impression, the name’s skywire, the gameplay mechanic was rather simple: you hold or release the key buttons to either stop or move the cable car through-out the track and avoid getting hit by any obstacle, you have 3 lives only. But as for a game on a website, the level design as well as the graphics were just next level at that time, not to mention the music too. It was a very well made game. As I got closer to secondary school, I had a friend of mine who invited me to his home, where I got to find out about the assassin’s creed franchise and minecraft. At first I was captivated by both the amazing graphics and the engaging gameplay from these games. Later on there was this question that popped up in my head: "how were these games created?" That was when I started to dig deeper into the subject.</p>

<li> <b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </b></li>
<p> As I got closer to finishing high school, I came to realize that RMIT is the best university to come to as I want a study environment where I get to use English more often, as well as being able to take the IT course. Not to mention, RMIT is very close to my home, it usually takes me 10mins to arrive the university.</p>

<li> <b> What do you expect to learn during your studies? </b></li>
<p> I expect to learn about coding, web programming, security in computing and information technology, building IT systems. </p>
</ul>
<h2> <u> 3. Ideal Job </u> </h2>
<ul>

<li> <b> The job advertisement </b></li>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1888371918/?eBP=NotAvailableFromVoyagerAPI&refId=09532c56-6e92-421d-9851-34ecf0d61d91&trk=flagship3_search_srp_jobs" > Link to the job advertisement </a>

<li> <b>The position's description </b></li>
<p> -Cygames is looking for additional staff to expand their business, the position seems usual compared to other companies but it’s actually very appealing to me because I’d get to work as a game development engineer in the company that made the gacha game (Granblue Fantasy) that I enjoy playing so much and I would love to contribute to Cygames in improving their games and work on future projects.</p>

<li> <b> Skills, qualifications, and experience required for the position </b> </li>
<p> -Being able to acquire this job is no easy task, the experience and skills, qualifications I need to have are: Consumer game development and implementation experience (3 years or more), C++ game program development experience (3 years or more). </p>

<li> <b>skills, qualifications, and experience I currently have </b> </li>
<p> -I have little experience with web programming and creating games as I have learned these during secondary school but never got to learn about them again in the later years and up until now, so my skills are very rusty at the moment. </p>

<li> <b>A plan how I will obtain the skills, qualifications, and experience required for the position </b> </li>
<p> -My plan is to finish the bachelor of information technology and acquire as much knowledge and experience in the field as I can, once I have finished with university I’ll continue learning more about C++ and consumer game development and implementation. Not to mention I need to start learning Japanese as I will be working in a completely different environment where people will be using Japanese very frequent. Finally I’ll be applying for the job. </p>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> <b> Test results </b> </li>
<p> <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality" > Link to Myers-Briggs test </a> </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=8&V=8&T=4" > Link to learning style test </a> </p>
<p> <a href="https://www.truity.com/personality-test/17315/test-results/23550626" > Link to big five personality test </a> </p>
<li> <b> What do the results of these tests mean for you? </b> </li>
<p> I feel that these personality tests have helped me to have a better understanding about myself, although there are some statements that are not exactly true but most of the remaining ones describe me very accurately. Not only that, they also give me hypothetical advice when there are situations we don't think about. As for the learning style test, I have never expected the test result would contain tips to assist me in my future studying, so I was very surprised reading through the results. All of these tests were super helpful for me. </p>

<li> <b> How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team? </b> </li>
<p>I doubt these results would have a great influence to my behavior in a team. Because I would just still be myself but there are advices I would definitely take in heart to avoid any possible conflict when working in a team. </p>

<li> <b> How should you take this into account when forming a team? </b> </li>
<p> I can actually work with anyone in a team so as long as they communicate and contribute enough. But the ideal team would still be a team that’s consisted of just friendly, energetic, and hardworking people. </p>
</ul>

<h2> <u> 5. Project ideas </u> </h2>
<ul>
<li> <b> Overview </b> </li>
<p> The project will be about creating a turn- based, strategy game that will have a gacha system. There will be a large amount of waifus, husbandos and equipment for the player to collect to be able to form up different team compositions to perform differently through-out the game and farm for upgrade materials that the game’s contents have to provide. </p>

<li> <b> Motivation </b> </li>
<p> This project is inspired by many turn-based and gacha games that I have played before: Granblue Fantasy, Bang dream, Honkai Impact 3, the Persona series, some Final Fantasy games, etc… There are different things that I have taken in interests from the mentioned games that always make their sales on towering positions such as: good character design; engaging, fun gameplay and combat; a wide variety of characters with different personalities; and good story telling.  I want to create such an amazing gacha game that will gather many players who are interested in the genre not because I just want to make money, since developing video games is also what I am passionate about, especially turn-based gacha game. </p>

<li> <b> Description </b> </li>
<p> The complete product will be a role-playing video game with turn based combat, and gacha (capsule-toy vending machine) system. The player will start out with a team of the starter units in the game, as they venture through the story, they will gain different types of currency starting with the coin which will be used for upgrading, trading for materials in the shop, uncapping characters and equipment. Then, we have the crystal, which is the currency that will be used for pulling the gacha for chances of recruiting better characters that come along with a weapon, this indicates that pulling the gacha for just characters is clearly not enough, because the player will also need to acquire better weapon to advance further in the story as well as clearing the raids, or quests to farm materials for uncapping the characters and equipment, the materials can also be used for crafting new weapons, armor and accessories which can be accessed in the shop tab. Characters will have different weapons proficiency for example: This one character can only use weapons that are staff, dagger type whereas the other character can only use weapons that are melee, axe type. But all characters are still able to use any armor, accessories that the player has. Once the player have reached a certain point in the story, this is where the grind actually begins. Yes, they will have to farm for more experience to reach to the required rank level to attend certain raids in search for sources to gain new materials, and farm for new weapons. There will be events that come and go, so when an event is active, it is advised that the players should start farming these events for specific items so that they can trade for upgrades, the equipment that has the event’s theme, and the materials in the event shop. The player can also earn crystals from the events but there is a cap to it. As the player proceeds closer to the end of the story, they will unlock the most challenging raids, and quests for them to start farming for end-game materials, and chances for new weapons to drop from these end-game raids. Quests that are for materials farming can only be done by just the player and their party, whereas the raids will have limited amount of players that can join in and help each other out to finish the raid and attain the rewards (each player will get different drops because the drop rate varies). Aside from all the grinding for materials and equipment, the player can also build up relationship bonds between each character that they have recruited by sending gifts, the gifts can be obtained through buying in the shop tab and it will cost just coins, but they will be very high-priced. Once the player have reached the maximum level of a relationship with a character they will have the option to make that character call the player in any given nickname they want. By that time the player will be able to read through special dialogues from the maxed bond character on how he/she feels about the player. So the end-game activities for the players would be farming for coins to buy gifts and build up relationship bonds with all the characters they have, helping other players in any raid, stocking up resources for possible future updates. </p>

<li> <b> Tools and technologies </b> </li>
<p> I will need to draw the game on paper first and do a live test with my friends who already have experienced turn-based games. So that I’ll be able to get feedbacks from them and know whether my game is fun and playable or not before I can implement my ideas and start working on the project. Unity is the engine I will be using to create the game, and finally I’ll be buying Playmaker as it will be used for visual scripting on Unity. </p>

<li> <b> Skill required </b> </li>
<p> This project requires the proficiency in programming language: C++, the game also needs a good story so it will also depend heavily on the story writing as well as developing characters’ personalities. In addition I'll be needing character, graphic and visual design which will be contingent on artistic ability. Finally, the sound design, this will be dependent on the creativity. </p>
